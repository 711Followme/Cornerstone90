    book: "Nehemiah",
    chapter: 1,
    verses: "1-11",
    title: "Obedience and Broken Walls",
    passage: "The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: During the month of Chislev in the twentieth year, when I was in the fortress city of Susa, Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with men from Judah, and I questioned them about Jerusalem and the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile. They said to me, \"The remnant in the province, who survived the exile, are in great trouble and disgrace. Jerusalem's wall has been broken down, and its gates have been burned down.\" When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for a number of days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven. I said, Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps His gracious covenant with those who love Him and keep His commands, let Your eyes be open and Your ears be attentive to hear Your servant's prayer that I now pray to You day and night for Your servants, the Israelites. I confess the sins we have committed against You. Both I and my father's house have sinned. We have acted corruptly toward You and have not kept the commands, statutes, and ordinances You gave Your servant Moses. Please remember what You commanded Your servant Moses: \"If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples. But if you return to Me and carefully observe My commands, even though your exiles were banished to the ends of the earth, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I chose to have My name dwell.\" They are Your servants and Your people. You redeemed them by Your great power and strong hand. Please, Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to that of Your servants who delight to revere Your name. Give Your servant success today, and have compassion on him in the presence of this man. At the time, I was the king's cupbearer.",
    reflection: "Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the king - a position of influence, comfort, and security. Yet when he heard about the broken walls of Jerusalem, he didn't ignore it or rationalize it away. He faced reality head-on. He wept. He mourned. He fasted. He prayed.\n\nWhat are the broken walls in your life? Your marriage? Your integrity? Your relationship with your children? Your walk with God? Like Nehemiah, the first step isn't fixing - it's facing. It's sitting down and truly seeing the rubble for what it is.\n\nNehemiah could have stayed comfortable in the palace. Instead, he used his position for God's purposes. He didn't despise his job or his influence - he leveraged it for the Kingdom. Where has God positioned you? Your workplace, your neighborhood, your family - these aren't accidents. They're assignments.\n\nNotice Nehemiah's response: prayer and fasting BEFORE action. He didn't run to the king first. He ran to God. For days. This is the foundation of everything that follows.",
    application: "Today, identify one 'broken wall' in your life. Don't fix it yet. Just face it. Sit with it. Weep over it if you need to. Then pray. Ask God what He wants to do through you in your current position. Write down what He shows you.",
    prayer: "Lord, give me Nehemiah's heart - a heart that breaks over what breaks Yours. Help me face the broken walls in my life honestly, without excuses or denial. Show me how to use my position, my influence, my resources for Your purposes. I commit these next 90 days to rebuilding what's been broken. Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Honor: Do not lie, cheat, steal, or laugh at sin. - Nehemiah refused to laugh off the broken state of Jerusalem. He took sin and brokenness seriously."

    book: "Matthew",
    chapter: 6,
    verses: "10-18",
    title: "Prayer and Fasting: The Foundation",
    passage: "Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For if you forgive people their wrongdoing, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. But if you don't forgive people, your Father will not forgive your wrongdoing. Whenever you fast, don't be sad-faced like the hypocrites. For they make their faces unattractive so their fasting is obvious to people. I assure you: They've got their reward! But when you fast, put oil on your head, and wash your face, so that you don't show your fasting to people but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.",
    reflection: "Jesus doesn't say 'if you fast' - He says 'when you fast.' He expects it. Prayer and fasting aren't optional extras for super-spiritual Christians. They're baseline disciplines for anyone serious about following Christ.\n\nWhy these next 90 days? Because transformation doesn't happen by accident. It happens through intentional, sustained spiritual disciplines. You're not just reading a devotional - you're entering a season of fasting from comfort, praying through brokenness, and building on the only foundation that lasts: Christ.\n\nNotice the progression in the Lord's Prayer: God's kingdom first, then daily provision, then forgiveness (given AND received), then protection from evil. Your prayers should follow this pattern - not 'gimme' prayers but 'Thy will be done' prayers.\n\nFasting reveals what controls you. When you can't have something, you discover what has you. The next 90 days will expose your idols - comfort, food, entertainment, approval. Let them surface. Then surrender them.",
    application: "Choose one thing to fast from during these 90 days (beyond just food - consider social media, TV, etc.). Write it down. Tell your accountability partner. Begin today. Use the hunger or craving as a reminder to pray.",
    prayer: "Father, Your kingdom come, Your will be done in my life. I surrender my comfort, my control, my excuses. Teach me to pray. Teach me to fast. I don't want comfort - I want transformation. Use these 90 days to break what needs breaking and build what needs building. Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Perseverance: Whether in a workout, or in our lives, we strive to leave a legacy of never quitting. - These 90 days are about perseverance in disciplines, not just motivation."

    day: 3,
    book: "Jeremiah",
    chapter: 29,
    verses: "11-13",
    title: "Intercessory Prayer: Caring for Your Charge",
    passage: "For I know the plans I have for you—this is the Lord's declaration—plans for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. You will call to Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.",
    reflection: "This famous verse is often ripped from its context. God spoke these words to exiles in Babylon - people who had lost everything. The promise wasn't for immediate rescue. It was for 70 years later. God was saying, 'I haven't forgotten you. Build houses. Plant gardens. Pray for the city where I've placed you.'\n\nNehemiah prayed for Jerusalem - the city of his people, even though he was far away in Susa. He carried the burden of those in his charge. Who are you responsible for? Your wife? Your children? Your employees? Your neighbors? Are you praying for them? Truly interceding?\n\nIntercessory prayer isn't casual. It's standing in the gap. It's carrying someone else's burden before God. It's saying, 'Lord, if judgment must come, let it fall on me instead.' Moses did it. Nehemiah did it. Christ did it perfectly.\n\nGod's plans for you are good - but they require your partnership. He says, 'You will call on me... you will seek me with ALL your heart.' Not half-hearted. Not when convenient. All your heart.",
    application: "Make a list of 5 people you're responsible for (family, employees, those you mentor). Commit to praying for them by name daily for the next 90 days. Set a phone alarm if needed. This is non-negotiable.",
    prayer: "Lord, I intercede for those You've placed in my charge. Give me a shepherd's heart that carries their burdens, prays for their protection, and seeks their good above my own comfort. Reveal Your plans to me as I seek You with all my heart. Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Trust: Give others the benefit of the doubt. - Intercessory prayer assumes the best and asks God to bring it forth in others."

    day: 4,
    book: "Nehemiah",
    chapter: 1,
    verses: "4",
    title: "Weeping: Sign of Weakness?",
    passage: "When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for a number of days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven.",
    reflection: "We see weeping across the Bible, from men of valor like David, to Jesus Himself. But this is not weakness. It is the strength to hold compassion for others and the willingness to feel with them.\n\nNehemiah wept when he heard about Jerusalem's broken walls. David wept over his sin with Bathsheba, over the death of Absalom, over enemies who opposed God. Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb, and He wept over Jerusalem's coming judgment. These were not weak men. They were warriors, kings, and the Son of God.\n\nOur culture tells men to suppress emotion, to 'man up,' to never show vulnerability. But biblical manhood includes the capacity to weep - not from self-pity, but from deep compassion. When you weep over sin, over brokenness, over those who are lost, you're standing in a long line of godly men who understood that tears can be an act of worship.\n\nKnowing we are helpless as humans, but allowing our burdens and giving them to God helps us allow Him to work through us to change what we are feeling deeply about. Nehemiah didn't just weep - he wept, then fasted, then prayed, then acted. His tears led to transformation.\n\nWhen was the last time you wept over something that breaks God's heart? When did you last feel the weight of someone else's pain so deeply that it moved you to tears and then to prayer? This isn't weakness. This is the heart of Christ in you.",
    application: "Ask God to break your heart today. Sit quietly and ask: 'What breaks Your heart, Father?' Write down what comes to mind. If tears come, let them. Then pray. Ask God what He wants you to do about what He's shown you. Compassion without action is incomplete, but action without compassion is empty.",
    prayer: "Lord, give me a heart that weeps over what You weep over. Remove my hardness, my stoicism, my fear of feeling deeply. Help me understand that tears of compassion are not weakness but strength - the strength to care, to feel, to intercede. Show me where You're calling me to move from tears to action. Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Encouragement: No matter what happens you can always say, 'Good' - When we allow ourselves to feel deeply and give our burdens to God, He works good even through our tears."

    day: 5,
    book: "1 John",
    chapter: 1,
    verses: "8-10",
    title: "Confession: Owning Your Part",
    passage: "If we say, \"We have no sin,\" we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say, \"We have not sinned,\" we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.",
    reflection: "John doesn't mince words: if you claim you have no sin, you're a liar. Worse, you're calling God a liar. This is the brutal honesty the church desperately needs. We live in an age of excuses, deflection, and therapeutic Christianity that never names sin as sin.\n\nConfession isn't therapy. It's not 'sharing your truth' or 'processing your feelings.' It's agreeing with God about reality. It's saying, 'You're right. I'm wrong. I sinned. No excuses.'\n\nNotice the promise: God is FAITHFUL and RIGHTEOUS to forgive. Not just willing - faithful. It's in His character. When you confess, you're not begging for mercy from a reluctant deity. You're activating a promise from a covenant-keeping God who already paid the price for your sin.\n\nBut there's a second part: cleanse us from ALL unrighteousness. Confession isn't just about forgiveness - it's about transformation. God doesn't just wipe the slate clean and leave you to fall again. He cleanses you. He changes you. But it starts with owning your sin.\n\nLike Nehemiah who confessed 'I and my father's house have sinned,' you must own your part. Stop blaming your upbringing, your circumstances, your spouse. What's YOUR sin? Name it. Confess it. Then watch God cleanse it.",
    application: "Write down three specific sins you've been avoiding or minimizing. Not categories - specific sins. 'I lied to my boss about why I was late.' 'I've been viewing pornography.' 'I spoke harshly to my wife in front of the kids.' Confess each one out loud to God. Then, if your sin affected someone else, confess to them. Today. Delayed confession is ongoing rebellion.",
    prayer: "Father, I confess that I am a sinner. Not in theory - in practice. I've sinned against You and against others. I name my sin: [be specific]. I'm not making excuses. I'm not blaming others. I own this. Thank You that You are faithful to forgive and to cleanse me. Change me from the inside out. Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Honor: Do not lie, cheat, steal, or laugh at sin. - True honor means calling sin what it is and owning it without excuse."

    day: 6,
    book: "Joshua",
    chapter: 1,
    verses: "5-9",
    title: "Remembering God's Promises",
    passage: "No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live. I will be with you, just as I was with Moses. I will not leave you or forsake you. Be strong and courageous, for you will distribute the land I swore to their fathers to give them as an inheritance. Above all, be strong and very courageous to carefully observe the whole instruction My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or the left, so that you will have success wherever you go. This book of instruction must not depart from your mouth; you are to recite it day and night so that you may carefully observe everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in whatever you do. Haven't I commanded you: be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.",
    reflection: "Joshua stood at the edge of an impossible task. Moses was dead. The promised land was filled with giants. The people were afraid. And God says, 'Be strong and courageous.' Three times in five verses. This isn't a suggestion - it's a command.\n\nBut notice: courage isn't rooted in Joshua's ability. It's rooted in God's promise: 'I WILL be with you. I will NOT leave you or forsake you.' Courage isn't the absence of fear. It's acting despite fear because you trust God's presence and promises.\n\nGod told Joshua to meditate on His Word day and night. Not because God needs us to impress Him with Bible knowledge, but because WE need to saturate our minds with truth. When you're facing giants - broken marriages, financial ruin, rebellious children - you need to KNOW what God has said. Not just heard it once. KNOW it.\n\nLike Nehemiah who prayed God's promises back to Him, Joshua was called to stand on what God had already declared. The walls of Jericho didn't fall because Joshua was talented. They fell because God promised they would, and Joshua believed Him.\n\nWhat walls are you facing? What promise of God have you forgotten? 'I will never leave you' - do you believe it? 'I will be with you' - are you living like it's true?",
    application: "Open your Bible and find three promises of God that speak directly to your current situation. Write them down on a notecard. Put it in your wallet, on your mirror, in your truck. Memorize them. When fear comes, quote them out loud. God's promises aren't just nice thoughts - they're weapons against doubt and fear. Use them.",
    prayer: "Lord, You have promised to never leave me or forsake me. You've promised to be with me wherever I go. You've commanded me to be strong and courageous because YOU are with me. I choose to believe Your promises today. When I face giants, when walls seem impossible, when I'm tempted to quit - I will remember what You've said. Make me a man who stands on Your Word, not on my feelings. Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Trust: Give others the benefit of the doubt. - When we trust God's promises, we can extend that same trust to others, believing God is at work."

    chapter: 20,
    verses: "8-11",
    title: "Sabbath Rest: The Builder's Rhythm",
    passage: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy: You are to labor six days and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. You must not do any work—you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the foreigner who is within your gates. For the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything in them in six days; then He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and declared it holy.",
    reflection: "Week 1 is complete. You've faced your broken walls. You've wept, fasted, prayed, confessed, and remembered God's promises. Now rest.\n\nSabbath isn't laziness. It's trust. It's saying, 'God, You're big enough to run the world without me for a day.' Nehemiah didn't rebuild the walls in a frenzy of non-stop activity. He rested, reflected, and renewed his strength in God.\n\nThe world says, 'Work harder. Do more. Prove your worth.' God says, 'Rest. I've already proven your worth on the cross. Stop striving. Trust Me.' Sabbath is an act of rebellion against the tyranny of productivity.\n\nToday, you're not building. You're resting. Not because the work is done, but because God commanded it. Not because you've earned it, but because He's given it as a gift. In rest, you remember that you're human and He's God. That's the proper order.\n\nGod didn't need to rest after creation. He rested to set a pattern for us. If the Creator rested, who are you to think you don't need to? Rest isn't a sign of weakness. It's a sign of wisdom.",
    application: "Today is Sabbath. Here's what you WON'T do: work, check email obsessively, scroll social media mindlessly, binge Netflix. Here's what you WILL do: worship, rest, spend time with family, reflect on the week, enjoy creation, read for pleasure, take a walk, nap guilt-free. Write down three things you're grateful for this week. Thank God for them. Then rest.",
    prayer: "Lord, teach me to rest. I confess I've made an idol of productivity. I've believed the lie that my worth is tied to my work. Today I choose to trust You. I lay down my need to control, to achieve, to prove myself. Thank You for this gift of Sabbath. Help me to truly rest in You, knowing that You're more than enough. Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Humility: It's better to under sell and over deliver. - Sabbath rest is the ultimate act of humility, admitting we need rest and can't do everything ourselves."

    day: 8,
    book: "Nehemiah",
    chapter: 2,
    verses: "1-7",
    title: "Faithfulness in the Waiting",
    passage: "During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was set before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence, so the king said to me, \"Why are you sad, when you aren't sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.\" I was overwhelmed with fear and replied to the king, \"May the king live forever! Why should I not be sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?\" Then the king asked me, \"What is your request?\" So I prayed to the God of heaven and answered the king, \"If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah and to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I may rebuild it.\" The king, with the queen seated beside him, asked me, \"How long will your journey take, and when will you return?\" So I gave him a definite time, and it pleased the king to send me. I also said to the king: \"If it pleases the king, let me have letters written to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates River, so that they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah.\"",
    reflection: "From chapter one to chapter two, Nehemiah prayed, fasted, and waited on God's timing for nearly 4 months. This part of chapter two we see Nehemiah speaking to his King 4 months after hearing about the people of Judah, and he has been faithful to both his King, Artaxerxes and His Lord, our God this entire time. Being patient in knowing that only on God's time will he be able to do anything to help those he cares about. Being obedient in recognizing to ask his Lord for blessings before his worldly King. Though he was fearful of presenting his request to his King, he still first prayed to God before making known his plan.\n\nThere are times where even when we feel deeply about something, even though we have chosen to pray and fast over it so that we may be able to hear God and know when He says we are ready, we may be waiting weeks, months, even years before getting that blessing from Him. It's important to remember to remain faithful and obedient during that time, just as Nehemiah did.\n\nIf you have chosen to fast because of something you know you need God's blessing on before you act, then remain faithful in that choice - don't take it half-hearted, and as we saw earlier don't do it with a poor demeanor. Know that your choice is for a reason, and that it has a good cause behind it, and God in front of it!",
    application: "As we enter week two of these 13 weeks, it's going to seem like the fasting days are longer, the disciplines are just that much harder to keep and you're going to want to just quit. Don't. Remain faithful. When that sugar craving comes up, think about why it's there, and take that moment to pray, using that time to have a conversation with God. A REAL conversation. When you're bored and you want to pick up the phone and jump onto scrolling, or shopping, or watching YouTube, stop and pray, or maybe grab a journal and jot down a new prayer/revelation about your day. The simple disciplines are the ones that start to feel hard, use them to draw you closer in relation to God and remember to keep track of the ones you are doing well just as much as the ones you're not. Those wins are faithful moments, the losses are just more room for God.\n\nLet's do this - other than your why, identify one area of your life that NEEDS your focus, bring God into it, allow Him the room to work it for you, and in the mean time take this week to dedicate your day or days of fasting to that thing. Remain faithful there, and watch for God to give you the time and space needed to begin that focus. Don't act yet, do as Nehemiah and give it to God to tell you when.",
    prayer: "Lord Heavenly Father, I know it is Your will, and not mine; Your timing and not mine. I'm making a commitment to stepping out of Your way, and remaining faithful knowing You have control. I ask for patience as I watch You work, and for patience for my brothers who are making this same commitment, that we may be able to keep each other accountable, to You. In Jesus name, Amen.",

    book: "Nehemiah",
    chapter: 2,
    verses: "7-10",
    title: "Planning with God's Blessing",
    passage: "I also said to the king: \"If it pleases the king, let me have letters written to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates River, so that they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah. And let me have a letter written to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, so that he will give me timber to rebuild the gates of the temple's fortress, the city wall, and the home where I will live.\" The king granted my requests, for I was graciously strengthened by my God. I went to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent officers of the infantry and cavalry with me. When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard that someone had come to seek the well-being of the Israelites, they were greatly displeased.",
    reflection: "We see here the further effects of the four months of conversing with God, fasting and being faithful -- a clear plan. Nehemiah didn't just request to go and 'see what I can do to help', he knew by this time what would be needed, how he would need to do just that, and who would be in his way. His request for letters, to specifically those that would help and those that would potentially hurt, meant Nehemiah put serious thought into what it was going to take to rebuild these walls. He also knew that (just as with asking God for blessing on a path or plan) his King would respond well to a plan rather than a theory. This was a bold ask. Nehemiah was close to the King as his cupbearer but this would not be something normally entrusted to someone in his position. He knew he had God's blessing upon him first, had a solid plan to present, and allowed himself to be humble yet confident when making his request. This is the reason the King affords him officers on his journey, not just peasants or slaves but officers who hold positions of authority and leadership.\n\nThese are steps we tend to overlook in our daily leadership. Sometimes we jump into things without seeking God's will, or maybe we feel we have sought God's will but have not done the proper planning and jump in haphazardly, and then others we tend to saunter up and make demands of either those with our needed resources or those we are to lead with an overconfidence and ego a mile wide. There may not be Kings and Queens and feudalistic governments any longer, but God established a hierarchy to our lives and this should remain respected and keep us humble - We are Sons of God first, (if we are married) we are Husbands to our Wives (if we are not) then we are our Parents Sons next, (if we have children) We are Fathers (And if again no children) We are Brothers to our siblings and each other. We remain humble in this hierarchy, but steadfast in our position so we can bring needed confidence.\n\nThe second thing we see here is the immediate opposition to even the idea of what Nehemiah is intending. Bear in mind he has yet to fully explain to anyone what he plans to do other than he has begun to make moves to rebuild the walls, and already Sanballat and Tobiah are displeased and would by now most likely hold plans of creating obstacles. This is a roadblock that we will always face. One that is triggered anytime we hold steadfast in our position, and have the blessing of our Lord. Some say that when a plan is blessed by the Lord it is easy - and this is true in that God will go before you and prepare the path - but this does not mean that it will not present a threat to the enemy and trigger a roadblock to deter you. Expect them, plan for them, and stay confident that God will help to keep your path clear. Don't let the obstacles make you think it's time to turn around and run or quit. Most of the time these can be indicators that you are on the Right path and must keep moving toward the goal.",
    application: "Today, take the area you identified yesterday (Day 8) that needs God's focus in your life. Now it's time to plan. Don't act yet - but start building a clear plan. Write down: 1) What specifically needs to happen? 2) What resources will you need? 3) Who has authority over those resources? 4) Who might oppose this plan? Just like Nehemiah, present to God a plan, not just a theory. Ask Him to bless your planning. Show Him you've been faithful in the waiting by being faithful in the preparation. Remember: humble in hierarchy (seek wisdom from those God has placed over you), but confident in calling (you know God has blessed this). And here's the truth - if opposition shows up this week, don't run. Opposition often confirms you're on the right path. Expect it. Plan for it. Keep moving forward.",
    prayer: "Father, thank You for the waiting season. Now I ask for wisdom in the planning. Show me the clear steps I need to take. Reveal what resources I'll need and who can provide them. Give me humility to respect the hierarchy You've established in my life - as a son, as a husband, as a father, as a brother. But also give me confidence in the calling You've placed on my life. I know opposition is coming. Prepare my heart for it. Don't let obstacles make me think I'm on the wrong path. Instead, let them confirm I'm exactly where You want me. I will not run. I will not quit. I will keep building. In Jesus name, Amen.",

    title: "Survey Before Building",
    passage: "After I arrived in Jerusalem and had been there three days, I got up at night and took a few men with me. I didn't tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took was the one I was riding. I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Serpent's Well and the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire. I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but farther down it became too narrow for my animal to go through. So I went up at night by way of the valley and inspected the wall. Then heading back, I entered through the Valley Gate and returned. The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet told the Jews, priests, nobles, officials, or the rest of those who would be doing the work. So I said to them, \"You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned down. Come, let's rebuild Jerusalem's wall, so that we will no longer be a disgrace.\" I told them how the gracious hand of my God had been on me, and what the king had said to me. They said, \"Let's start rebuilding,\" and they were encouraged to do this good work.",
    reflection: "We see a recurring theme here - planning. Nehemiah took time to carefully plan once he arrived in Jerusalem. Not only has he waited 4 months to speak to the King - all the while praying, fasting and planning - but then rode from Susa to Jerusalem, and still waited 3 days to speak to the priests, and did his survey/assessment of the damages in secrecy so as to prevent quarreling over the progress. This is careful, deliberate, intentional, and fully invested. This is the way we as men need to lead our lives, our families, our communities, our jobs, and just as important - our church. We need to ensure that we are careful as to who we allow for our council around us, there are times that if wise council cannot be found then we need to spend more time listening to God and allowing Him even more room to work. We need to ensure that we are deliberate when planning - we need to keep the end goal in mind, have timelines set for ourselves and have a strong knowledge of the battlefield we are working in.\n\nThe next thing we see here is his Call To Action - \"Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we will not be of reproach\". Picture this as not a simple monotoned ask, but rather him standing in front of many priests, and the citizens, calling to each of them with fervor and determination. This is the kind of motivation Jerusalem needed - They had been trying to rebuild the walls for many years prior to this, they needed a fresh voice, motivation. Nehemiah rallied the people because he knew he was not going to build the wall on his own. \"I am not too proud to ask for help, I belong to a Tribe and do not struggle alone\" He needed the Tribe to build the wall. He wasn't going to get it by force, he wasn't going to get it by doing it alone and hoping for help. He had to ask. Let's have the confidence to present our plan to those we need the help from, but the humility to ask them in the first place. Nehemiah began this early with his King and the way he presented himself there, he continues this here.",
    application: "'So we are not of reproach' - Merriam Webster's definition of reproach: an expression of disappointment. The state of Jerusalem was a disappointment to the Jews, to others, and in their sight to God. Are we holding ourselves 'beyond reproach'? Are we building lives that do not exemplify disappointment from God? From ourselves? We are not building walls in this to hold people out of our lives, we are building walls here to protect our lives from reproach -- solid foundation on God keeping Him as our 'Cornerstone'; blocks formed and placed with humility. All of this carefully, and deliberately planned to make sure we are being the strong leaders and builders our families and communities need us to be.\n\nLet's do some survey again today. Just as in Day 1. Let's be honest with ourselves and take the time to ride around our broken walls in the night to see what needs to be done. Where do you still need to rebuild? Have you found new places that are needing repair or fortification? Have the disciplines made it clear where you hold your comforts - keep your gates open to the enemy? Has God showed other areas where you are missing a cornerstone since you have started this?",
    prayer: "Father, I come before You tonight to survey my walls. Show me where I still need rebuilding. Reveal the gates I've left open to the enemy - the comforts I've clung to, the disciplines I've neglected, the areas where I've removed You as my Cornerstone. Give me the honesty to see the rubble for what it is, not what I wish it were. And Lord, when the survey is complete and I see the full extent of the damage, don't let me be overwhelmed. Instead, give me the faith to rally my tribe, to ask for help without pride, to present my plan with humble confidence. Help me to be a man beyond reproach - not perfect, but faithful. Not without broken walls, but willing to rebuild them on You. Give me the courage to call others to action: 'Come, let us build.' I know I cannot do this alone. Thank You for my brothers, for this tribe, for the gracious hand You've placed on me. Let's start rebuilding. In Jesus name, Amen.",

Commit your activities to the Lord, and your plans will be achieved. A man's heart plans his way, but the Lord determines his steps.",
    reflection: "Nehemiah had a plan. A detailed, well-thought-out, God-blessed plan. But here's what we see throughout his story: he continually committed his plans to God. He didn't just pray once and assume God would rubber-stamp everything thereafter. He prayed before speaking to the king. He prayed while surveying the walls. He prayed when opposition arose. His planning was saturated with prayer.\n\nProverbs tells us 'all a man's ways seem right to him' - you can convince yourself anything is God's will if you want it badly enough. This is why we need the second half: 'the Lord evaluates the motives.' Are you building walls for God's glory or your own? To protect what He's given you, or to showcase what you've accomplished? Motives matter.\n\n'Commit your activities to the Lord, and your plans will be achieved.' This isn't prosperity gospel - it's a promise that when you genuinely commit your work to God, He takes responsibility for the outcome. You plan, but HE determines your steps. This week you've surveyed, planned, and rallied your tribe. Now commit the work to God. Not just the outcome - the daily process, the setbacks, the small victories, the tedious tasks. All of it.\n\nNehemiah's plans were achieved not because he was brilliant (though he was wise), but because he committed everything to God. Your walls will be rebuilt the same way.",
    application: "Take your plan from Day 9 and literally commit it to God in writing. Write at the top: 'Lord, I commit this to You.' Then underneath, list each major step of your plan with a prayer next to it. For example: '1) Talk to my wife about our finances - Lord, give me the right words and timing.' '2) Meet with financial advisor - Lord, lead me to wise counsel.' Do this for every step. Then pray over the entire document. Keep it visible. This isn't just making a to-do list - it's acknowledging God's sovereignty over each step. You plan, but He determines your steps. Commit the work. Trust the outcome to Him.",

Also, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; but how can one person alone keep warm? And if someone overpowers one person, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not easily broken.",
    reflection: "Nehemiah didn't rebuild the walls alone. He couldn't. No one can. When he rallied the people with 'Come, let us build,' he understood a fundamental truth: we need each other. Not just for the physical work, but for the moments when we want to quit, when opposition feels overwhelming, when our own strength fails.\n\n'If either falls, his companion can lift him up.' You're going to fall this week. Maybe not physically, but spiritually, emotionally. You'll want to quit the disciplines. You'll be tempted to compromise. You'll face opposition that makes you want to run. When that happens, your brothers can lift you up - but only if you've been honest with them about where you are.\n\n'Pity the one who falls without another to lift him up.' The lone wolf mentality is a lie from hell. You were not designed to rebuild your walls alone. God created you for tribe, for brotherhood, for the Men's Alliance. The question isn't whether you'll need your brothers - it's whether you'll humble yourself enough to ask for their help when you do.\n\n'A cord of three strands is not easily broken.' You, your brothers, and God. That's the unbreakable cord. Nehemiah had his tribe. Joshua had Caleb. David had Jonathan. Moses had Aaron and Hur. Jesus had Peter, James, and John. Who do you have?

Don't generalize - be specific. Say: 'I'm rebuilding my marriage. I need you to ask me every week how I spoke to my wife.' Or: 'I'm rebuilding my integrity. I need you to check on whether I'm viewing porn.' Give them permission to get in your business. Better yet, ask them what they're rebuilding so you can return the favor. You're not meant to do this alone. Stop trying.",

Carry one another's burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. For if anyone considers himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. But each person should examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in respect to someone else. For each person will have to carry his own load. So we must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don't give up.",
    reflection: "We're at Day 13. You've been faithful for almost two weeks. The initial motivation is wearing off. The disciplines feel harder. The fast feels longer. You're tired. This is exactly where Paul says, 'We must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don't give up.'\n\nNotice: 'at the proper time.' Not on your timeline. Not when you think you deserve it. At the PROPER time - God's time. Nehemiah waited 4 months. Then he waited 3 more days. Then he surveyed in secret. The entire process from hearing about Jerusalem's walls to actually starting construction took months. He didn't grow weary in the waiting because he trusted God's timing.\n\nPaul also reminds us: 'Carry one another's burdens... but each person will have to carry his own load.' This isn't contradictory. Some burdens are too heavy to carry alone - financial crisis, marital breakdown, addiction. Carry these together. But your daily load - your disciplines, your responsibilities, your choices - those are yours to carry. Your brothers can encourage you, but they can't do your pushups. They can't fast for you. They can't rebuild your walls.\n\n'We will reap if we don't give up.' The harvest is coming. But only if you don't quit at Day 13, Day 30, Day 60. Nehemiah reaped because he didn't quit. You will too.",

But before you rest, let's address something crucial: Why are you doing this?\n\nPaul tells Timothy that the goal of all instruction - all teaching, all discipline, all spiritual practice - is LOVE. Love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith. Not a checklist. Not a badge of honor. Not proving yourself to God or others. Love.\n\nJonathan Edwards wrote: 'Knowledge of God serves as fuel for the fires of our affections for Him.' Every discipline you've practiced these 14 days - the fasting, the prayer, the planning, the tribe activation, the perseverance - all of it is fuel. Fuel for a deeper relationship with God. Fuel for affection. Fuel for love.\n\nHere's the danger: You can rebuild walls and miss the Builder. You can complete 90 days and never draw closer to God. You can check every box and have a cold heart. Religion does this. Legalism does this. Performance does this. But relationship? Relationship transforms.\n\nThis Sabbath isn't just about physical rest. It's a reminder that everything you're doing - EVERYTHING - is to deepen your relationship with God. Not to earn His love. Not to prove your worth. But to know Him more, to love Him more, to experience His presence more fully.\n\nYou're not just checking off Day 14. You're pausing to remember WHO you're building for and WHY you're building at all.",

Maybe it's a trail in the woods. But find a place and a time where it's just you and God.\n\nGo there today. Take your Bible, but don't treat it like a textbook. Talk to God like He's sitting next to you - because He is. Tell Him what you've learned these two weeks. Ask Him what He's trying to teach you. Listen. Really listen. Don't perform. Don't try to pray 'correctly.' Just be with Him. Let knowledge of Him fuel your affections for Him. This isn't about checking a box. This is about relationship. Spend at least one hour - uninterrupted, undistracted - simply being with God. Not for Him. With Him.",

I don't want to rebuild walls and miss the Builder. I don't want to finish 90 days with a cold heart and a full journal. I want to know You more. I want to love You more. I want my affections for You to burn hotter with each day of this journey. Today, I set aside time and space to simply be with You. No agenda. No performance. No proving myself. Just relationship.

After building the wall to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel, they dedicated it. The men of Jericho built next to Eliashib, and next to them Zaccur son of Imri built. The sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate. They built it with beams and installed its doors, bolts, and bars. Next to them Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, made repairs. Beside them Meshullam son of Berechiah, son of Meshezabel, made repairs. Next to them Zadok son of Baana made repairs. Beside them the Tekoites made repairs, but their nobles did not lift a finger to help their supervisors.",
    reflection: "Chapter 3 of Nehemiah is a detailed list of who rebuilt which section of the wall. At first glance, it seems tedious - just a roster of names and gates. But look closer. The HIGH PRIEST Eliashib worked alongside common builders. The men of Jericho - a city once cursed - were now rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. Goldsmiths and perfume-makers left their comfortable trades to haul stones. Daughters worked beside their fathers. Rulers worked next to servants.\n\nEveryone had a gate. Everyone had a section. No one was too important or too insignificant. The wall couldn't be rebuilt if even ONE person refused their assignment.\n\nBut notice verse 5: 'The nobles of Tekoa did not lift a finger to help.' Everyone else was building. Everyone else was sweating. Everyone else was invested. But the nobles? They thought the work was beneath them. Pride kept them from the wall. And their section? Still broken.\n\nYou have a gate. A specific section of wall that only you can rebuild. Not someone else's gate - yours. Maybe it's your marriage (the Family Gate). Your integrity (the Honor Gate). Your finances (the Stewardship Gate). Your health (the Temple Gate). Your legacy (the Legacy Gate). What gate has God assigned to you?\n\nHere's the truth: If you don't rebuild your gate, the enemy has access. It doesn't matter how strong the rest of the wall is.

Next to them Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler over half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs. Beside them Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs across from his house. Next to him Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs. Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab made repairs to another section, as well as to the Tower of the Ovens.

With Christ Jesus as the CORNERSTONE.\n\nWhat's a cornerstone? In ancient construction, the cornerstone was the first stone laid, set at the corner where two walls meet. It determined the position and alignment of the entire structure. If the cornerstone was off by even a degree, the whole building would be crooked. Everything had to be measured against the cornerstone.\n\nChrist is your Cornerstone. Not your feelings. Not your past. Not your circumstances. Not even your progress. HIM. When you're measuring your gate, your wall, your life - measure it against Christ. Is this aligned with who He is? Is this building on Him or on shifting sand?\n\n'Being built together' - this isn't solo construction. You're not a standalone building. You're part of a HOUSEHOLD.

    passage: "According to God's grace that was given to me, I have laid a foundation as a skilled master builder, and another builds on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it, because no one can lay any other foundation than what has been laid—that is, Jesus Christ. If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, each one's work will become obvious, for the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire; the fire will test the quality of each one's work. If anyone's work that he has built survives, he will receive a reward. If anyone's work is burned up, it will be lost, but he will be saved; yet it will be like an escape through fire.",
    reflection: "You can build on the right foundation (Christ) but with the wrong materials. Wood, hay, and straw are cheap, fast, and easy. Gold, silver, and costly stones require time, investment, and intentionality. Both will build a wall. But only one survives the fire.\n\nWhat materials are you using to rebuild your gate? Are you using shortcuts (wood, hay, straw)? Or are you investing in quality (gold, silver, costly stones)? Let's make this practical:\n\nWOOD, HAY, STRAW materials:\n- Quick fixes instead of deep repentance\n- Surface-level behavior modification instead of heart transformation\n- Building for appearances instead of building for God\n- Doing just enough to check the box instead of going all-in\n- Relying on your own strength instead of God's power\n\nGOLD, SILVER, COSTLY STONES materials:\n- Deep confession and genuine repentance\n- Sustained disciplines even when no one's watching\n- Building for God's glory, not human approval\n- Going beyond the minimum to pursue excellence\n- Daily dependence on God's strength, not your own\n\n'The fire will test the quality of each one's work.' This isn't about losing salvation - Paul says you'll be saved even if your work burns up. But there's a difference between finishing the race and finishing well. You can rebuild your gate with cheap materials and it might look good for a while. But when trials come (and they will), when temptation returns (and it will), when pressure builds (and it always does) - will your gate stand? Or will it burn?\n\nYou're 18 days in. You've identified your gate. You're working alongside your brothers. You've aligned to the Cornerstone. Now ask: What materials am I using?",
    application: "Audit your materials. Take an honest look at how you're rebuilding your gate. For each area below, circle one:\n\n1. My repentance is: SURFACE LEVEL (wood) or DEEP & GENUINE (gold)\n2. My disciplines are: WHEN CONVENIENT (hay) or DAILY & CONSISTENT (silver)\n3. I'm building for: APPEARANCES (straw) or GOD'S GLORY (costly stones)\n4. My effort level is: MINIMUM REQUIRED (wood) or PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE (gold)\n5. I'm relying on: MY STRENGTH (hay) or GOD'S POWER (silver)\n\nBe brutally honest. If you circled more than two items on the left, you're using cheap materials. Don't condemn yourself - just commit to upgrading. How? More prayer. Deeper confession. Greater dependence on God. Higher standards. This week, identify ONE cheap material you're using and replace it with a costly one.",
    prayer: "Father, I confess I've been using cheap materials. I've taken shortcuts. I've settled for surface-level change instead of deep transformation. I've built for appearances instead of for Your glory. I've relied on my own strength instead of Yours. Forgive me. I don't want to build a gate that looks good but won't survive the fire. I want to build with gold, silver, and costly stones - materials that last, materials that honor You. Show me where I'm cutting corners. Convict me when I'm settling for less than Your best. I want to finish well, not just finish. Help me build with materials that will survive the fire. In Jesus name, Amen.",

    day: 19,
    book: "James",
    chapter: 1,
    verses: "2-4, 12",
    title: "Testing Produces Endurance",
    passage: "Consider it a great joy, my brothers, whenever you experience various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. But endurance must do its complete work, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing. A man who endures trials is blessed, because when he passes the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love Him.",
    reflection: "Week 3. Day 19. You're almost a third of the way through. By now, you've hit resistance. The initial excitement is gone. The disciplines feel like drudgery. The fast is exposing your idols. Your brothers are asking you the hard questions you hoped they wouldn't. Opposition has shown up (remember Sanballat and Tobiah?). You're tired. You're tempted to quit.\n\nJames says: 'Consider it a great joy.'\n\nWait, what? JOY? In trials? In testing? In the grind of Day 19 when you'd rather give up?\n\nYes. Because the TESTING of your faith produces ENDURANCE. And endurance isn't just the ability to survive - it's the ability to keep rebuilding even when you don't feel like it, even when progress is slow, even when no one's applauding.\n\n'Endurance must do its COMPLETE work.' If you quit at Day 19, you don't get the maturity that comes at Day 90. If you take shortcuts now, you won't be 'mature and complete, lacking nothing' later. The testing has a PURPOSE - to make you the kind of man who ENDURES, who FINISHES, who doesn't quit when it gets hard.\n\n'When he passes the test he will receive the crown of life.' Notice: WHEN he passes, not IF. God expects you to pass. He's given you everything you need. The question is: Will you endure? Will you keep rebuilding when the materials feel heavy? Will you keep working when your brothers seem to be progressing faster? Will you push through Day 19, Day 30, Day 60?\n\nNehemiah faced mocking, threats, and sabotage. He endured. The wall was finished in 52 days. Your wall will be finished in 90 days - but only if you endure the testing of Day 19.",
    application: "Name your current test. What's testing you right now? What's making you want to quit? Is it the fast? The accountability? The slow progress? The opposition? The exposure of your hidden sin? Write it down: 'My current test is: _______.' Now underneath, write: 'This test is producing endurance in me. I will not quit. I will consider it joy because God is completing His work in me.' Keep this visible. When Day 30 feels impossible, when Day 60 feels like you're going backwards, when Day 80 feels like nothing's changed - read this. The test is working. Endurance is being formed. Don't quit before the complete work is finished.",
    prayer: "Father, I confess this is hard. Day 19 feels heavier than Day 1. The testing is revealing things I didn't want to see. The disciplines are harder than I thought. I'm tempted to quit. But I won't. Not because I'm strong, but because You're producing endurance in me. This test has a purpose. This trial is making me mature and complete. I choose to consider it joy - not because I feel joyful, but because I trust You're doing a complete work. Help me endure. When Day 30 comes and I'm still struggling, remind me: the test is working. When Day 60 comes and I feel like quitting, remind me: endurance is being formed. I will pass this test. I will receive the crown of life You've promised. I will endure. In Jesus name, Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Perseverance: Whether in a workout, or in our lives, we strive to leave a legacy of never quitting. - Day 19 is where endurance is tested and perseverance is proven."

    chapter: 12,
    verses: "1-3",
    title: "Fixing Our Eyes on Jesus",
    passage: "Therefore, since we also have such a large cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily ensnares us. Let us run with endurance the race that lies before us, keeping our eyes on Jesus, the source and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that lay before Him endured a cross and despised the shame and has sat down at the right hand of God's throne. For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, so that you won't grow weary and lose heart.",
    reflection: "You have a cloud of witnesses. Men who've rebuilt their walls before you. Abraham. Moses. Joshua. David. Nehemiah. Peter. Paul. Men who faced broken walls and didn't quit. Men who endured opposition and kept building. Men who stumbled, got back up, and finished the race. They're watching. Not judging - cheering.\n\nBut here's the key: don't fix your eyes on THEM. Fix your eyes on JESUS. 'The source and perfecter of our faith.' He STARTED your faith (source) and He'll FINISH it (perfecter). Your job isn't to finish your own faith. It's to keep your eyes on the One who finishes it FOR you.\n\nJesus 'endured a cross and despised the shame.' Think about that. The Son of God endured the ultimate broken wall - separation from the Father. He endured mocking, betrayal, abandonment, torture, and death. Why? 'For the joy that lay before Him.' The joy of YOUR redemption. The joy of YOU being able to rebuild your walls because He rebuilt the ultimate broken gate between you and God.\n\nWhen you're rebuilding your Marriage Gate at Day 20 and it feels impossible - remember Jesus endured the cross. When you're rebuilding your Integrity Gate and the enemy whispers you'll never change - remember Jesus despised the shame and sat down at the right hand of God. When you grow weary and want to lose heart - CONSIDER HIM. He endured. So can you.\n\n'Lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily ensnares us.' What's weighing you down? What sin keeps tripping you up? Lay it aside. Not next week. Not after you feel ready. TODAY. Keep your eyes on Jesus, not on your sin. Not on your progress. Not on your brothers' progress. On JESUS.",
    application: "Identify the 'weight' and the 'sin' in your race. What's slowing you down that isn't even sin - just unnecessary weight? (Maybe it's binge-watching shows, scrolling social media, overcommitting to things that don't matter.) What's the sin that 'so easily ensnares' you? (Pornography? Anger? Pride? Lying?) Write both down. The weight: _______. The sin: _______. Now, lay them aside. Literally. Take the paper and tear it up. Throw it away. Confess the sin to God and to your accountability partner. Remove the weight from your life this week - delete the app, cancel the subscription, say no to the commitment. Then fix your eyes on Jesus. Not on what you gave up. On who you're running toward.",
    prayer: "Lord Jesus, I fix my eyes on You. Not on my progress. Not on my failures. Not on my brothers. On YOU. You are the source of my faith - You started this rebuilding project in me. And You're the perfecter - You'll finish what You started. When I grow weary, remind me that You endured the cross for the joy of my redemption. When I want to quit, remind me that You despised the shame and sat down at the right hand of God. I lay aside the weight of _______ and the sin of _______. I don't need them. I need You. Keep my eyes fixed on You. Finish the work You started. I'm running this race to the end because You've already won it for me. In Your name, Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Encouragement: No matter what happens you can always say, 'Good' - When we fix our eyes on Jesus, we can say 'Good' to every trial because we know He's using it for our ultimate joy."

    day: 21,
    book: "Psalm",
    chapter: 127,
    verses: "1-2",
    title: "Sabbath Rest: Unless the Lord Builds",
    passage: "Unless the Lord builds a house, its builders labor over it in vain; unless the Lord watches over a city, the watchman stays alert in vain. In vain you get up early and stay up late, working hard to have enough food— yes, He gives sleep to the one He loves.",
    reflection: "Week 3 is complete. You've identified your gate (Day 15). You've worked alongside your brothers (Day 16). You've built on the Cornerstone (Day 17). You've upgraded your materials (Day 18). You've endured the testing (Day 19). You've fixed your eyes on Jesus (Day 20). You've been faithful. You've worked hard.\n\nNow hear this: Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor IN VAIN.\n\nAll your effort, all your planning, all your disciplines, all your accountability - if God isn't building it, it's worthless. This isn't discouraging. It's FREEING. You're not responsible for the outcome. You're responsible for obedience. You're responsible for showing up. You're responsible for laying the stones. But GOD is responsible for building the house.\n\nNehemiah worked hard. Nehemiah planned meticulously. Nehemiah rallied the people. But Nehemiah PRAYED CONSTANTLY. He knew the truth of Psalm 127: Unless the Lord builds, we labor in vain. So he let the Lord build. He cooperated with God, he didn't compete with God.\n\n'He gives sleep to the one He loves.' Rest isn't just physical. It's spiritual. It's trusting that God is big enough to keep working while you sleep. You don't have to hold it all together. You don't have to rebuild your gate in your own strength. God's got this. He's building. Your job is to rest in that truth.\n\nThis Sabbath, STOP. Stop working. Stop striving. Stop trying to control the outcome. Let God build. You've been faithful for 21 days. That's enough for this week. Rest.",
    application: "Today is full Sabbath rest. No rebuilding. No planning. No gate work. Just rest and worship. Here's your assignment: Find a place where you can be alone with God (not in your house if possible - go somewhere). Bring your journal. Write down everything you've worked on these 21 days - your gate, your disciplines, your struggles, your victories. Then write across the top: 'Lord, I've been faithful. Now I trust You to build.' Pray this out loud. Then close the journal. For the rest of the day, don't think about your gate. Don't plan next week's strategy. Don't worry about your progress. Just REST. Worship. Spend time with family. Read for pleasure. Take a nap. Enjoy a meal. Remember: He gives sleep to the one He loves. You are loved. You can rest.",
    prayer: "Father, I surrender my work to You. I've been faithful these 21 days. I've identified my gate. I've worked alongside my brothers. I've built on Christ the Cornerstone. I've upgraded my materials. I've endured the testing. I've fixed my eyes on Jesus. Now I trust You to build. Unless You build, I'm laboring in vain. So I rest. I stop striving. I stop trying to control the outcome. I lay down my need to see immediate results. I trust that You're building even when I can't see it. Thank You for giving sleep to the one You love. I am loved by You. I can rest in that truth. Build my house, Lord. I'm just here to obey, to show up, to lay the stones You place in front of me. But You're the Builder. You're the Architect. You're the Finisher. I rest in You. In Jesus name, Amen.",
    mensAllianceValue: "Humility: It's better to under sell and over deliver. - Sabbath rest is ultimate humility, admitting that unless the Lord builds, our efforts are in vain. We rest in His love, not our performance."
