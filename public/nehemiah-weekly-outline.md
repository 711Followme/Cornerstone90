"I, _________________, commit to the NEHEMIAH WEEKLY 90-Day Reading Plan. For the next 90 days, I will:
- Read Scripture daily
- Journal my reflections and applications
- Honor the Sabbath weekly
- Meet with my accountability partner
- Apply what I learn, not just read

## FINAL THOUGHTS

This plan is built on Nehemiah's framework:
- **Nehemiah wept** (emotional engagement)
- **Nehemiah prayed** (spiritual dependence)
- **Nehemiah planned** (strategic thinking)
- **Nehemiah acted** (courageous execution)
- **Nehemiah persevered** (relentless determination)
- **Nehemiah finished** (completion and celebration)

You will do the same. In 90 days:
- Your character will be forged
- Your disciplines will be established
- Your leadership will be developed

But only if you finish. Only if you don't quit. Only if you apply what you learn.

**The wall will be built. 52 days was enough for Nehemiah. 90 days is enough for you.**
