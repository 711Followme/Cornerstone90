# 📥 Add Your PNG Logo Here

## You have 2 options:

### Option 1: Contact your developer/hosting platform
Since this is a web-based IDE, you'll need to:
1. Contact your platform support (Layout/Lovable)
2. Ask them how to upload binary files (PNG images)
3. They should have a file upload feature

### Option 2: Use base64 encoding (temporary)
1. Convert your PNG to base64: https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image
2. Tell me the base64 string
3. I'll embed it directly in the HTML/manifest

### Option 3: After deployment
Once your app is deployed, you can:
1. Access your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. Upload PNG files directly to the /public/ folder
3. Redeploy

## Files Needed:
- `cornerstone-icon-192.png` (192x192px)
- `cornerstone-icon-512.png` (512x512px)

## Current Status:
✅ SVG icon works (cornerstone-icon.svg)
⏳ Waiting for PNG versions to be uploaded

The app will work fine with just the SVG icon for now!
